## Overview

### The challenge


Your challenge is to build out this feature illustration using HTML & CSS and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The only assets we provide in this challenge are the image of the person in the app UI and the 3 images of the dog. You need to create everything else using HTML & CSS!
